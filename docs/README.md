# Open Source project to get familiar with the basics of soldering, electronics and programming.
This compact 4 cm × 4 cm PCB, powered by a CR2032 coin cell and driven by an ATtiny13A microcontroller, is designed to make learning electronics engaging and accessible. Equipped with a blinking LED, clearly labeled components, and Arduino IDE compatibility via a dedicated programming header, it offers a hands-on introduction to soldering, microcontrollers, and embedded programming. Originally developed for university workshops, its minimalist design and modular approach make it perfect for classrooms, makerspaces, and self-guided learners alike. At a low cost of around €1.50 per unit, it’s affordable enough for every participant to take home: Ecouraging continued exploration and tinkering beyond the workshop.
